    <h2>Climate action refers to efforts taken to combat climate change and its impacts. These efforts involve reducing greenhouse gas emissions (climate mitigation) and/or taking action to prepare for and adjust to both the current effects of climate change and the predicted impacts in the future (climate adaptation).</h2>

        <h1>Why climate action is important?</h1>
        <h2>Climate action helps to preserve and protect natural habitats, biodiversity, and ecosystems. 
            Many species are vulnerable to changes in temperature, precipitation patterns, and sea levels associated with climate change. 
            By taking action to reduce emissions and conserve natural resources, we can safeguard ecosystems and the services they provide, such as clean air, water, and soil.</h2>

            <h1>Current situation of climate action.</h1>
            <h2>Climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such 
                as heat waves, droughts, floods and tropical cyclones, aggravating water management problems, 
                reducing agricultural production and food security, increasing health risks, damaging critical 
                infrastructure and interrupting the provision of basic services such water and sanitation, 
                education, energy and transport.</h2>
